## About
Version 1.0 has been released! This new version of python-droit comes with many new features. Beside implementing new features and restructuring python-droit developer-friendliness was also improved. There is a documentation for the code as well as some tutorials on how to use python-droit. The Droit Database Script will still be supported and even extended. It won't be abolished because it has a lot of advantages compared to Droit XML.
